reglasJuego = In "Ghostbusters" the rules are very simple, there's a board with a pyramid form in whose base are the ghostbusters which are controlled by the player, above them, 5 types of ghosts to capture and in the top of the pyramid, the leading ghost. The player has to throw a dice a maximum of 7 times to get a number between 1 and 2 which decides the number of vertical positions the player can advance one of his ghostbusters to eliminate an enemy. If the player eliminates one ghost of each type excluding the leading ghost he gets a 10% of discount, if the player also eliminates the leading ghost, he will get a 25% of discount.\n¡Good luck in your adventure!
